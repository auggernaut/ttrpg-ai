  <strong>Ironsworn</strong> is an award-winning tabletop role-playing game of perilous quests that stands out for its flexibility and focus on narrative-driven adventures. Unlike many RPGs, Ironsworn is designed to support solo and co-operative play in addition to the traditional GM-led format. Set in the <strong>Ironlands</strong> – a rugged, Viking-inspired fantasy frontier – players take the role of heroes who <strong>swear iron vows</strong> to complete dangerous quests in a harsh world. It’s a game of personal quests, unforgiving landscapes, and emergent storytelling.
